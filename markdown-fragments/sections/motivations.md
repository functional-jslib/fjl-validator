## Motivations:
- Needed a way to supply custom error messages to different value validation scenarios.
- Wanted to use validators in a functional way.
- Needed a base library from which to build more complex ones ('fjl-input-filter', 'fjl-validator-recaptcha' etc.).
- Needed a base library that could later, easily, accommodate validating via optionally using promises (
    'fjl-input-filter' lib exports methods for this).
