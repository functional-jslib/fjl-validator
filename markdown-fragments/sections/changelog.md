## Change log

### 1.6.2
- String support for `takeWhile`, `group`, and `groupBy`, `dropWhileEnd`.
- Tablelized tests for `takeWhile`, `dropWhileEnd`, and `dropWhileEnd`.

### 1.6.0
- A few more functions now support strings:
    - `map`, `intersperse`, `append`, `reverse`, and `concat`.
- `range` function doc-block updated.
- `listUtil` functions updated and their docs unblocked from jsdocs.
- `listUtil` methods are now exported from 'src/list'.
- Tests overhaul stage 1 progress.  
    - Converted some tests to table format (where implementations were touched and 
        where the functional programming style was too extreme).
    - Removed some library functions from tests where said functions were not being tested (use native functions for tests only (no-library functions intermingle (in tests))).
- Cleaned up imports in some places to protect from cyclic dependency issues.

### 1.5.1, 1.5.2
- Added './types/index.d.ts' file.

### 1.5.0

##### Changes that affect development of the library:

#### Other changes
- Cleaned up README.md to reflect latest changes.
- Curried functions (functions curried via `curry*` functions) now retain their arity property value (`length` value).

### 1.3.0
- Added `noop` (no-op (op as in operation)) method (useful as a placeholder for variables/properties that should always contain a function).
- Added test for `noop` addition.
- Updated './docs'.
